# HSR Equipment Calculator

## Overview

This equipment calculator uses the Tesseract OCR software to parse an image for data, and applies weighted values to the stats to calculate a rating for the equipment. I might upgrade the program from a CLI to an actual application if I feel like it.

## Usage

After you finish rolling your equipment, take a screenshot containing only the equipment level and stats.

After running the application, it will prompt for the name of the character using the equipment, followed by the name of the image file. After inputting the image, the equipment calculator will provide detailed information about the equipment, followed by an overall score. You can then change characters, or input a new image file to analyze more equipment. To quit, simply enter "q".
